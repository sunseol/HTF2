# Status Report (2025-10-11)

## Summary
- Default Gemini model updated to gemini-2.5-flash; `.env` is now the sole config source.
- Gemini chunking, JSON parsing, and fallback logging remain instrumented for visibility.
- Playwright capture and Gemini calls still share the withTimeout wrapper so timeouts drop to heuristic mode gracefully.
- HtmlProcessingService options (.env driven capture/vision timeouts) continue to support fast vs. balanced vs. quality modes.

## Recent Tests
- `npx ts-node --transpile-only scripts/gemini-smoke.ts`
  - Playwright capture + Gemini call + heuristic fallback completes in ~2s locally.
  - With a valid API key the script writes vision summaries and chunk logs to `logs/gemini-smoke.log`.
  - At the 5 minute timeout the job exits with `ERROR: job timed out...` for observability.

## Action List
- [x] Strengthen Gemini Flash integration and chunk logging.
- [x] Document `.env` bootstrapping (template removed).
- [x] Surface timeout/heuristic metadata in logs.
- [ ] Monitor Gemini chunk logging in staging/production and tune logger levels as needed.
- [ ] Expand post-vision adjustment rules so spacing/padding fixes apply automatically.
